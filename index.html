							<h2 class="wlc-title">Theme Requirements</h2>
							<p>To use Rifa, make sure your hosting provider is running the following software:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>WordPress 4.8 or higher.</li>
								<li>PHP 5.6 or greater. WordPress <a
										href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/">officially
										suggests</a> to
									use PHP 7.4.
								</li>
								<li>MySQL 5.6 or greater.</li>
							</ol>

							<h4 class="wlc-title-inner mt-40 mb-10">Recommended PHP Limits</h4>
							<p>Many issues that you may run into such as: white screen, demo content fails when
								importing,
								empty page content and other similar issues are all related to low PHP configuration
								limits.
								The solution is to increase the PHP limits. You can do this on your own, or contact your
								web
								host and ask them to increase those limits to a minimum as follows:</p>

							<ul class="pl-20">
								<li><code>max_execution_time 180</code></li>
								<li><code>memory_limit 128M</code></li>
								<li><code>post_max_size 64M</code></li>
								<li><code>upload_max_filesize 32M</code></li>
								<li><code>max_input_time = 60</code></li>
								<li><code>max_input_vars = 3000</code></li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Also consider upgrading your PHP version to the
								<a href="http://php.net/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest
									version</a>, the newer the better.

							<h5 class="bold-text">Corn Settings</h5>
							<p>There are 2 types of Crons</p>
							<p><strong>1. WP Cron</strong></p>
							<p>WP Cron is supported in all WordPress sites by default(Unless turned off manually in the
								wp-config file). The main disadvantage of WP Cron is that it will trigger only when
								someone visits the site. For example, If there is no site activity for some time say 10
								days, the cron will not be triggered on those 10 days.</p>
							<p><strong>2. Server Cron</strong></p>
							<p>Server Cron is an alternate to WP Cron. The main advantage of Server Cron is that it is
								not dependent on site activity. But, Server Cron requires separate configuration. As far
								as we know, it cannot be configured using a Plugin within the site. It can only be
								configured from the site’s C-Panel or control panel.<br>If you want to use WP Cron, then
								in <strong>“Select Cron Type”</strong> select <strong>“WP Cron”</strong>. If you want to
								run Server cron, select <strong>“Server Cron”</strong>. Please follow the steps
								mentioned in the <strong>“Server Cron Configuration”</strong> section.</p>
